# InfluxDb
The setup and query structure invlolved here is little different compared to that of a Relational database management system (RDBMS). 

## Installation

Download InfluxDb from [SetUp]. Unzip the contents onto a preferred folder on your pc/laptop.

![UnZip]

Click on _influxd.exe_ to start the InfluxDB server, by deault it runs on port **8086**. It can be changed in _influxdb.conf_ file under _bind_address_ according to user preference.

Below figure indicates that the server is running.
![Influx-Server]

Now click on _influx.exe_ to run the influxDB client. To create databases, query the data etc.
![Influx-Client]

Sample InfluxDB queries.  
```
>CREATE DATABASE IntrusionRTESDB
```
```
>USE IntrusionRTESDB
```
In order to insert to data to a table however it is a different procedure 
```
>INSERT intrusionMeasurements, esp32/XAcc=10 esp32/XGyro=12 esp32/YAcc=560 esp32/YGyro=456 esp32/ZAcc=678 esp32/ZGyro=33
```
This query will create a table _intrusionMeasurements_ along with columns which are mentioned in the query. If the timestamp is not specified in the query the primary key of the table will be the time stamp generated by influxDB in epoch format.
In case if you want to have a custome time stamp, In the influx CLI, you can add the timestamp at the end of the line, in nanosecond-precision Unix time,
```
> insert log value=1 1504225728000123456
```
In this project the data is being inserted from Node-RED nodes, refer [here](/Documentation/Node-RED.md).
